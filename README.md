## What is RuyiSDK

The RuyiSDK is an open-source project started by the Chinese Academy of Sciences (ISCAS), focusing on provide RISC-V developers with a easy and comprehensive way to doing development on RISC-V.

## Why RuyiSDK

RuyiSDK now provides a brand new chance for RISC-V development.

In the past, developers working on the RISC-V architechture are facing lack of a complete development environment. So that's why we created RuyiSDK.

- [x] Hard to get information of RISC-V

- [x] Lack of a Related Community

That's all RuyiSDK have solved!
